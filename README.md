# foodhub data analysis

For this project I analyse the dataset from a food delivery company FOODHUB.
In the presented notebook I perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) that includes univariante and multivariante analysis in order to optimize the income of FOODHUB.
I propose an alternative formula that should optimize FODDHUB revenue while helping restaurant to lower their weekday price to make lunch food delivery an attractive option for workers
